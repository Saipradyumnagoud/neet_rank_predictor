Here's the **README.md** for your NEET Rank Predictor project:

---

# NEET Rank Predictor

This project is a **NEET Rank Predictor API** built with **FastAPI** and machine learning models. It predicts a student's NEET rank based on various features like accuracy, time efficiency, difficulty average, and improvement rate. It also suggests eligible colleges based on predicted ranks using historical data and college cutoff ranks.

## 📦 **Technologies Used**
- **FastAPI** - For building the API.
- **Scikit-learn** - For training the machine learning model (Random Forest).
- **Pandas** & **Numpy** - For data manipulation and processing.
- **Joblib** - For saving and loading the trained model.

## 🛠 **Setup & Installation**

Follow these steps to get the project up and running locally.

### 1️⃣ **Create Project Folder**
Open your terminal/command prompt and run:
```bash
mkdir neet_rank_predictor
cd neet_rank_predictor
```

### 2️⃣ **Set Up Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**
Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
Activate it:
- **Windows:**
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **Mac/Linux:**
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3️⃣ **Install Dependencies**
Install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4️⃣ **Create Files**
Create the following files and add the corresponding code/data:

- `main.py` - The FastAPI backend file.
- `neet_historical_results.csv` - Dataset with historical NEET data for training the model.
- `neet_college_cutoffs.csv` - College cutoff ranks for various colleges.
- `requirements.txt` - List of all dependencies.

### 5️⃣ **Run the API Server**
Start the server with the following command:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

Once the server is running, you should see output like:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

## 📡 **API Endpoints**

### **🔹 Predict Rank (POST Request)**
To predict a NEET rank based on input features:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict-rank' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"accuracy": 85.5, "time_efficiency": 78.2, "difficulty_avg": 3.5, "improvement_rate": 4.2}'
```

**Response Example:**
```json
{
  "predicted_rank": 12000
}
```

### **🔹 Get College Predictions (GET Request)**
To get a list of colleges based on the predicted rank:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict-college/12000'
```

**Response Example:**
```json
{
  "eligible_colleges": ["AIIMS Delhi", "JIPMER Puducherry", "KMC Manipal"]
}
```

### **🔹 View API Documentation**
Go to **http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs** to interact with the API using Swagger UI.

## 📁 **Folder Structure**
Your project folder should look like this:

```
neet_rank_predictor/
│── venv/                     # Virtual environment (optional)
│── main.py                    # FastAPI backend
│── neet_historical_results.csv # Training dataset
│── neet_college_cutoffs.csv    # College cutoff ranks
│── neet_rank_model.pkl         # Saved ML model
│── requirements.txt            # Dependencies
```

## 📈 **Training the Model**

The model is trained using the historical NEET data (`neet_historical_results.csv`). The `main.py` file loads this data, selects the relevant features, and trains a Random Forest model to predict the NEET rank.

## 📦 **Deployment**

To deploy your API, you can use one of the following platforms:
- **Railway.app / Render.com** (for free hosting)
- **Docker** (for containerization)
- **AWS / Google Cloud** (for advanced hosting)

## 🎯 **Final Notes**
- FastAPI backend with a machine learning model for NEET rank prediction.
- API to predict rank and suggest eligible colleges based on NEET rank.
- Swagger UI documentation for easy interaction with the API.
